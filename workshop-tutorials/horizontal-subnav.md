# Rivet add-on: Horizontal sub-navigation
Create an add-on that displays horizontal sub-navigation that's separate from the main page navigation.

## How it should work
- Display a horizontal list of navigation links
- Highlight a navigation item when hovered over
- Highlight the currently selected navigation item
- Be usable at full width or within a narrower [Rivet grid](https://rivet.iu.edu/components/layout/grid/) item

## Example
- [GitHub profile navigation](https://github.com/scottanthonymurray): GitHub profiles display a horizontal sub-navigation that allows people to jump between the different pages of a profile (Overview, Repositories, Projects, etc...)

## Things to consider
Keep the following in mind when building the horizontal sub-navigation add-on:

- How would your add-on work for someone using assistive technology like a screen reader? How would the currently-selected navigation item be announced?
- How would your add-on display on smaller screens?
- How might a single-page application update the current navigation item in an accessible way?
