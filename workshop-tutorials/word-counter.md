# Rivet Add-on: Word Counter
This add-on is intended to allow users to see the number of words used or remaining in a given textarea.

## How it should work
There are things about the word counter that you will need to decide for yourself. Will your counter show the number of words written, the number of words left toward a word count maximum, or will developers be able to use it either way?

## Challenges
There are many important questions to keep in mind while building this add-on.

* Is what you built accessible? If not, what needs to change in order to make it accessible?
* What kinds of bugs might come up?
